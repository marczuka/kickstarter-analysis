# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Practicing Analysis
[Data-1-1-3-StarterBook_Statistics](https://github.com/marczuka/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Data-1-1-3-StarterBook_Statistics.xlsx)
is an Excel file containing practice part of the Analysis from Module 1.

## Challenge Analysis
[Data-1-1-3-StarterBook_Challenge](https://github.com/marczuka/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Data-1-1-3-StarterBook_Challenge.xlsx) is an Excel file containing the Module 1 Challenge Ananlysis of the Kickstarter Data.

In this part we've analized the chances to succeed or fail in crowdfunding for the category Theatre/Play depending on the Goal set for
the project. We've counted the percentage of Successful/Failed/Canceled and Live Outcomes for all the plays based on the range of money set as the goal for the play. We presented this the results in the following chart:

![Outcomes_Based_on_Goals_for_Plays.png](https://github.com/marczuka/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes_Based_on_Goals_for_Plays.png)

Looking at the chart we can see that the best chances to succeed (60-80% of all the projects) have plays with the goals with the relatively small Goals (less than $5000) and plays with the Goals in range between $35000 and $45000. The chances to succeed are drastically decreasing for the play with goals higher than  $45K. Plays with the goals higher than $5K and lower than $35K have lower than 60% chances to succeed with the lowest point for the Goals between $25K-$30K (lower than 20% chances to achieve the goal). 

We've also analized the chances to succeed or fail for all the projects in Category Theatre depending on the Launch date of the campaigne.
The following chart shows the percentage of Successful/Failed/Canceled and Live Outcomes for all the projects in parent category 'Theatre' based on the launch dates:

Looking at the chart we can see that the Theatre campaigns in general have good chances to succeed. Very little percent (below 10%) of Theatre campaigns end up being canceled. Yet there is 30-42% chances for the Theatre Campaigns to fail achieving their goals throuout the year with the worst periods in October and December. The best time to start a crowdfunding campaign for the Theatre category is between April and July (more than 60% of cuccessful campaigns).
